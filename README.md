 Password Strength Evaluation


🎯 Objective
The main objective of this task was to understand what constitutes a strong password and to evaluate its strength using online tools. The goal was to gain an understanding of password security and best practices.


💻 Tools Used

Online Password Strength Checkers: I used free online tools, such as passwordmeter.com or Kaspersky Password Checker, to test and evaluate the strength of various passwords.

📝 Deliverables

Password Report: I created multiple passwords with varying complexities, including combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, symbols, and different lengths. For each password, I noted the scores and feedback from the strength checker tool.



Best Practices Summary: Based on the evaluation, I identified and documented key best practices for creating strong passwords.


Research Summary: I researched common password attacks, such as brute force and dictionary attacks , and summarized how password complexity affects a password's security.


🚀 Key Concepts
This task provided a practical understanding of several key concepts in cybersecurity:


Password Strength: The resistance of a password to being compromised.


Brute Force Attack: A method of systematically trying every possible password combination.


Dictionary Attack: An attack that tries to guess a password using a pre-compiled list of words.


Authentication: The process of verifying a user's identity.
